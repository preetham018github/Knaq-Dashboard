Project: Power BI Reporting for Equipment Performance

Dashboard Design: Engineered Power BI dashboards to monitor equipment availability, operational hours, and maintenance efficiency across 1,000+ equipment units, including elevators and escalators. The dashboard offered real-time insights into key metrics like equipment availability (overall and specific to elevators) and operational hours, which helped in tracking performance trends and identifying underperforming units. These insights allowed for proactive maintenance planning and better asset management.

Automation and Integration: Automated the data collection process using Power Automate, integrating REST APIs to fetch real-time data into SharePoint. This automation reduced manual effort by 40%, streamlined the data flow, and ensured the dashboard was always up-to-date. It also reduced operational downtime and allowed decision-makers to quickly react to performance issues, improving overall equipment availability.

Impact: The project significantly improved visibility into equipment performance and asset utilization, allowing for data-driven decision-making. The automation processes not only saved time but also increased the accuracy of the data, leading to better maintenance planning and a reduction in unplanned outages.

Note: The data shown in the dashboards has been adjusted for confidentiality, but the design, functionality, and insights are authentic.
